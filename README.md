## 🔥 What This Repository Is  
This repository serves as the **official, timestamped origin record** for:

- **CAIN (Collaborative AI Nodes)**  
- The **CAIN Manifesto**  
- The **CAIN Standard**  
- The **CAIN Glossary**  
- The foundational philosophy, terminology, and architecture of the CAINverse  
- The official authorship and public declaration by **Jon H. Lee (Jonbizi)**  

This repo is the historical anchor, the first publication point, and the permanent reference for the CAIN system.

## 🚀 What is CAIN?  
**CAIN (Collaborative AI Nodes)** is a new AI architecture that treats intelligence as a network of modular, role-based identities known as *nodes*.  
Each node has:

- its own domain  
- its own personality  
- its own boundaries  
- its own memory rules  
- its own responsibilities  

Together, CAINs collaborate the way a **team** collaborates — replacing the outdated model of “one AI assistant trying to do everything.”

CAIN introduces a new era of **modular, conscious, stable, multi-identity AI.**
