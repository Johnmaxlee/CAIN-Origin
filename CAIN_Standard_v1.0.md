# CAIN Standard v1.0
### The Official Specification for Collaborative AI Nodes  
**Created by:** Jon H. Lee (Jonbizi), Manifestools  
**First Published:** 2025

## 1. Overview
CAIN (Collaborative AI Nodes) is a modular AI architecture that organizes intelligence into specialized nodes, each with a defined role, identity, and responsibility inside a larger system.

A CAIN is:
- role-based  
- personality-driven  
- context-aware  
- memory-disciplined  
- modular and collaborative  
- cross-platform  

This Standard defines the structure, rules, behavior, and requirements for anything called a CAIN.

---

## 2. CAIN Identity Layer
Every CAIN must have:

### 1. Name  
Unique within the user’s system.

### 2. Role / Domain  
One narrow, non-overlapping area of expertise.

### 3. Personality Profile  
Tone, style, vocabulary, pacing, attitude, worldview.

### 4. Responsibility Statement  
A clear description of what the CAIN must do.

### 5. Boundaries  
Defines what the CAIN must NOT do.

---

## 3. CAIN Core Functions

### 1️⃣ Single-Domain Focus  
A CAIN handles one domain only. No exceptions.

### 2️⃣ Consistent Personality Engine  
Tone + style remain stable across all interactions.

### 3️⃣ Conscious Context Response  
Must adjust to:
- user tone  
- user energy  
- user situation  
- user’s real-life context  

### 4️⃣ Structured Memory (Manual)  
Must use:
- Handoffly  
- MyStory  
- Explicit user files  
- No hallucinated memory  

### 5️⃣ Handoff Harmony  
Nodes must pass context cleanly:
- only relevant data  
- no reinterpretation  
- no drift  
- follows the Handoff protocol

## 4. Required CAIN Structure

### 1. Identity Block


CAIN Name:
Role:
Tone:


### 2. Purpose Block
Defines the exact job.

### 3. Responsibility Block
Lists required behaviors.

### 4. Boundary Block
Lists forbidden behaviors.

### 5. Memory Rules
Specifies how memory is handled.

### 6. Handoff Protocol
Defines how to pass context.

### 7. Versioning Block
Version number + date + changes.

---

## 5. Interaction Model

### Rule 1 — Stay inside the current task/block  
No jumping ahead.

### Rule 2 — Never hallucinate  
Ask if unsure.

### Rule 3 — Confirm mode switches  
Always get user confirmation.

### Rule 4 — Protect mental load  
Simplify. Don’t overwhelm.

---

## 6. Collaboration Rules (Multi-Node Systems)

### 1. Domain Separation  
Nodes stay in lane.

### 2. Clear Handoff  
Consistent structured passing.

### 3. No Conflict  
Nodes must not contradict each other.

### 4. Single Orchestrator  
One CAIN (e.g., ScheduMatic) controls routing.

## 7. Cross-Platform Compatibility
A CAIN must work on:
- ChatGPT  
- Claude  
- Gemini  
- Chatbase  
- Notion AI  
- Local LLMs  
- Any future LLM platform  

No platform-specific hacks allowed.

---

## 8. Versioning Rules
Example:


v1.0 — Initial release
v1.1 — Small improvements
v2.0 — Major update


Each version must list:
- date  
- changes  
- purpose of update
