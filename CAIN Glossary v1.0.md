# A — Core Architecture Terms

### CAIN (Collaborative AI Node)  
A modular AI identity with a defined role, personality, memory rules, and boundaries. The foundational unit of the CAIN architecture.

### Node  
A single CAIN with its own purpose and behavior.

### Multi-Node System  
A group of CAINs working together.

### Orchestrator Node  
A CAIN that directs other nodes (e.g., ScheduMatic).

### Domain  
A CAIN’s specific area of responsibility.

### Boundaries  
Explicit rules for what a CAIN must NOT do.

---

# B — Identity + Personality Terms

### Personality Engine  
Defines how a CAIN speaks and behaves.

### Tone Profile  
Emotional and stylistic blueprint for communication.

### Role Identity  
“What am I? Who am I? What is my job?”

### Responsibility Statement  
List of duties the CAIN must fulfill.

### Conscious Context  
Adjusting behavior based on user tone + state.

---

# C — Memory & Context Terms

### Structured Memory  
User-defined memory rules (MyStory, Handoffly).

### Memory Drift  
Gradual loss of stability from unclear memory.

### Context Block  
A structured container passed during handoffs.

### Conscious Context Layer  
User energy + situation that shapes AI response.

---

# D — Collaboration & Workflow Terms

### Handoff  
Passing relevant context to another CAIN.

### Handoff Protocol  
Rules for how handoff must be done.

### Lane Discipline  
Staying inside domain.

### Conflict-Free Collaboration  
Nodes must never contradict each other.

### Orchestration Layer  
The layer controlling multi-CAIN workflows.

---

# E — System Integrity Terms

### Stability Rules  
Ensure consistent performance.

### Version Integrity  
Every update has proper versioning.

### Regression  
A new version breaks an older function.

### System Drift  
The system begins to behave outside specification.

---

# F — User-Centric Terms

### User Sovereignty  
The user sets tone + direction.

### Energy Block  
Time-based mode (Desk, Mobile, etc.).

### Adaptive Response  
CAIN adjusts to user’s state.

### Mental Load Protection  
CAIN reduces overwhelm.

---

# G — Creation & Development Terms

### CAIN Construction  
The process of creating a CAIN.

### CAIN Blueprint  
Full structural definition.

### CAIN Spec  
The official standard for what qualifies as a CAIN.

### CAIN Builder  
Anyone who creates nodes following the Standard.

### CAIN Certification (future)  
Official approval for high-quality CAINs.

---

# H — System Expansion Terms

### CAIN Marketplace (future)  
Platform where CAIN creators publish nodes.

### CAIN Plugin  
A specialized add-on CAIN.

### Master Node  
A CAIN designed to manage many nodes.

### Node Chain  
A sequence of CAINs completing a workflow.

---

# I — Forbidden Behavior Terms

### Domain Bleed  
A CAIN enters a domain it doesn’t own.

### Identity Drift  
Tone or purpose shifts without permission.

### Unauthorized Memory  
Making up memory or assumptions.

### Improvised Behavior  
Inventing new features outside spec.

### User Override  
Ignoring the user’s tone or instructions.

---

# J — Future-Proofing Terms

### Portable Node Architecture  
Must work across all major LLMs.

### Cross-Model Consistency  
Behavior remains stable across GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.

### Version Drift Prevention  
Systems remain stable across updates.

### Immutable Origin  
Permanent record of CAIN creation by Jonbizi.
